\title{Filter \code{OnsetPattern} Output}
\description{This function takes an (multi-channel) onset pattern generated by \code{\link{OnsetPattern}}, and outputs a (one-dimensional) signal in which a non-zero value means an onset occurred (the value is a measurement of the likeliness for the onset). An onset is detected at a certain moment, if i) a certain fraction of channels have an onset within a specific period of time ii) the moment falls at least a minimum period of time behind the last detected onset
}
\usage{OnsetPatternFilter(inOnsetPattern, inSampleFreq)}
\arguments{
  \item{inOnsetPattern}{a matrix of size  \emph{n} x \emph{m} where \emph{n} is the length of time observations and \emph{m} is the number of channels.}
  \item{inSampleFreq}{the sample frequency of the incoming signal (in Hz).}}
\value{
\item{OnsetSignal}{a 1 dimension signal having a non-zero value at detected onset-times (the clearer the onset, the higher the value).}
  \item{OnsetSignalFreq}{sample frequency of the result (same as \code{inSampleFreq}).}}
