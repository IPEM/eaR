Description: This package contains an auditory model based on the analysis of envelope patterns within a set of critical subbands. A physiological representation of the auditory information is reconstructed as a multi-channel set of neuronal firing probabilities. With this, extraction of auditory nerve features are possible for perception-inferential purposes. Leman's auditory short-term memory model is ported to R.
